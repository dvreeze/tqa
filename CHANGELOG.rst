0.6.1
=====

Exactly the same as release 0.6.0. Release 0.6.0 could not be deployed to Maven Central, so release 0.6.1
comes in its place.


0.6.0
=====

Version 0.6.0 of TQA redesigned DocumentBuilders and TaxonomyBuilders. It also added an XBRL instance
viewer (created with Scala.js). The redesign of DocumentBuilders and TaxonomyBuilders causes some breaking changes.

The major changes are:

* Redesign of ``DocumentBuilder`` implementations on the JVM

  * Document builders targeting the JVM now take a URI resolver as extra argument, turning a URI into a SAX InputSource
  * Such a URI resolver can parse documents in ZIP files, like the ones in a Taxonomy Package
  * URI resolvers can also take a URI converter (function from URI to URI)
  * An XML catalog (as restricted by Taxonomy Packages) can be offered as such a URI converter
  * URI converters can be combined, and so can URI resolvers
  * A large portion of the test code now also uses ZIP files as test taxonomy document input

* Redesign of ``TaxonomyBuilder``, in particular of ``DocumentCollector``

  * Document collectors no longer contain the (entry point) document URIs as state
  * Instead, the taxonomy builder ``build`` method now takes the (entry point) document URIs
  * This makes taxonomy builders re-usable across entry points
  * Taxonomy package XML files can now be parsed, and provide entry point URIs via an entry point name, for example


0.5.0
=====

Version 0.5.0 of TQA supports Scala.js as second target platform. The API should start to feel more stable than in
previous releases.


0.5.0-M2
========

This milestone release is a step towards release 0.5.0, which supports Scala.js and which should make the API more
stable than was the case for previous releases.
